			<div>Swift is the result of the latest research on programming 
			   languages, combined with decades of experiences of experience building Apple
			   platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax
			   that makes APIs in Swift even easier to read and mantain. Even
			   better, you don´t even need to type semi-colons. Inferred types 
			   make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, while modules
			   eliminate headers and provide namespaces. To best support 
			   international languages and emoji, Strings are Unicode-correct
			   and use a UTF-8 based encoding to optimize performance for a 
			   wide-variety of use cases. Memory is managed automatically
			   using tight, deterministic reference counting, keeping memory
			   usage to a minimum withou the overhead of garbage collection.

			<div>Swift can open doors to the world of coding. In fact, it was designed
				to be anyone´s first programming language, whether you´re still in school
				or exploring new career paths. For educators, Apple created free curriculum
				to teach Swift both in and out of the classroom. First-time coders can download
				Swift Playgrounds - an app for iPad that makes getting started with Swift code
				interactive and fun.
